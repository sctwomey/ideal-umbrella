# Porfolio Code Challenge

## Description
This challenge requires a deployed portfolio of work samples to review work I have completed during the bootcamp. I will need to load a portfolio with my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me. If a link is clicked in the navigation bar, the UI will need to scroll to the corresponding section. The images need to be titled, and the application's image needs to be larger in size than all of the others on the webpage. When an image is clicked of a particular application, the user must be taken to the deployed application. The webpage should resize to fit the various screen sizes of different devices. So, the webpage must be responsive as seen in the gif below.
